# Fashion Design Analysis and Generation Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools for analyzing, generating, and managing fashion designs using AI and computer vision.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-core langchain-openai python-dotenv matplotlib transformers diffusers torch accelerate
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Available Tools and Commands

### 1. Fashion Design Generator
Generate fashion designs using Stable Diffusion:
```bash
python fashion_design_generator.py
```
- Generates unique design paths
- Creates high-quality fashion images
- Saves designs in `generated_designs` directory

### 2. Fashion Description Generator
Analyze fashion images using GPT-4V:
```bash
python fashion_descriptions.py
```
Features:
- Analyzes images from Season_1 and Season_2 directories
- Generates comprehensive descriptions including:
  - Overall Style & Category
  - Materials & Construction
  - Design Elements
  - Fit & Silhouette
  - Styling & Versatility
- Saves descriptions in `descriptions` directory

### 3. Fashion Knowledge Graph
Build and analyze fashion knowledge relationships:
```bash
python fashion_knowledge_graph.py
```
- Creates relationships between fashion elements
- Visualizes fashion design connections
- Helps in understanding design patterns

### 4. Visualization Tools
Visualize embeddings and relationships:
```bash
python visualize_embeddings.py
python visualize_graph.py
```
- Generate visual representations of fashion relationships
- Create interactive graphs
- Analyze design patterns

### 5. Design Analysis
Analyze existing designs:
```bash
python design_analysis.py
```
- Extract design features
- Analyze patterns and trends
- Generate insights from existing designs

## Workflow

1. **Design Generation**:
   - Generate new design paths
   - Create AI-generated fashion designs
   - Save designs with metadata

2. **Design Analysis**:
   - Analyze existing designs
   - Generate detailed descriptions
   - Extract design features

3. **Knowledge Graph**:
   - Build relationships between designs
   - Visualize connections
   - Generate insights

4. **Documentation**:
   - Save descriptions
   - Store metadata
   - Track design evolution

## Best Practices

1. **File Organization**:
   - Keep generated files in appropriate directories
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Maintain clear directory structure

2. **Code Style**:
   - Follow functional programming principles
   - Keep code files simple
   - Add proper error handling

3. **Design Process**:
   - Document design decisions
   - Save all metadata
   - Track design iterations

## Error Handling

- Check for required directories
- Validate input images
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Log errors and exceptions

## Notes

- Make sure to have sufficient GPU memory for design generation
- Keep your API keys secure
- Regular backups of generated content
- Monitor API usage and costs
