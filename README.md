# Intelligent Fashion Design Analysis and Generation System

A comprehensive AI-powered system for analyzing, understanding, and generating fashion designs using multi-modal deep learning models and knowledge graphs.

## Background

This project implements an intelligent design ideation system that combines computer vision, natural language processing, and generative AI to analyze and create fashion designs. The system uses a multi-stage pipeline that includes:

1. Design Brief Analysis using GPT-4V
2. Style Understanding using CLIP and Grounding DINO
3. Design Generation using Stable Diffusion XL
4. Quality Assessment using similarity metrics
5. Knowledge Graph-based Design Validation
